# The-Sparks-Foundation-Tasks

  This repository contains the tasks that I completed as part of the Data Science and Business Analytics internship at The Sparks Foundation. The tasks involve applying various machine learning and data analysis techniques on different datasets to solve real-world problems.

## Task-01: Prediction using Supervised machine learning

  This project implements a linear regression model to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours. The dataset contains the scores and study hours of 25 students. The goal is to find the best fit line that describes the relationship between the two variables and use it to make predictions.

## Task-02: Prediction using Unsupervised machine learning

  This project predicts the optimum number of clusters from the 'iris' dataset using K-means clustering. The iris dataset contains the 150 samples of three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to find the best value of k (the number of clusters) that minimizes the within-cluster sum of squared distances (WCSS).

## Task-03: EDA on Retail dataset  

  This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the 'sample superstore' dataset using Python to derive valuable business insights. The dataset contains the 9994 sales data of a fictional retail store in the US, with variables such as ship mode, segemnt, country, city, state, postal code, Region, product category, Sub-category,  sales, Quantity, Discount, profit.

## Task-06: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm 

   This project implements a decision tree algorithm on the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to classify each sample into one of the three species based on these features.

## Installation and Usage

To run these projects, you need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pydotplus
- graphviz

You can install these libraries using pip or conda. For example:

`pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn pydotplus graphviz`
Alternatively, you can use the requirements.txt file to install all the dependencies at once:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

1. After installing the dependencies, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-Talha4k/The-Sparks-Foundation-Tasks.git

The notebooks contain the code and explanation for each task.
